    <h2>Traversing the Mountains!</h2>
    
       <p> One of the most enchanting things in today’s age is the ability to seek unto a divine freedom of the soul!
        Many men and women, dream of the clarity that they pursue time after time, especially because they don’t get it in their
        daily lives. While others, mostly travelers find this aspect of life to be an endless journey. One that is full of 
        clairvoyance, meaning and clarity that others can only imagine.And what better than the traversing of the mountains, 
        wandering across the horizon to find serenity in nature and introspect, take a peak in your pondering mind. Traveling 
        across the mountains without a clue, without a reason and without connectivity, especially to the rat race that we all take 
        part in on a daily basis. That’s a true reason why I always enjoy hiking, especially in the Himalayas, but even if I’m not
        in the Himalayas, walking across any mountain range gives me immense pleasure.
        One that you can only find when you surrender yourself to the unknown trails, paths, like your destiny that lead you to a 
        mesmerising sunrise, or an enchanting sunset! Traveling across the beauty of organic and natural surroundings without any 
        worldly worries. That’s something that I yearn for, especially when I want to detox, unwind and just completely disappear 
        into the wilderness.Sometimes I even feel there is a dire need for me to go back into complete dissonance of technology. 
        One that’ll help me attain a nirvana of sorts. I wonder how beautiful every single day would be, with just the nature, a 
        few books, okay maybe a Radio at best to give me company. Imagine the joy of visualising your dreams, settling down and 
        farming on a hilltop, viewing and experiencing the pleasure of sunrise and sunset without having to run for a meeting and
        or thinking about deadlines!
        Someday, that day will arrive soon! Until then, I keep meandering across the world finding the sweet spot, the balance of 
       life between my travels and my work. And it is these mountains that always help me rejuvenate and revive my spirit within, 
      to get back to the grind that will eventually help me get to that ‘Someday’ I’m looking for.</p>

    <h2> Old Kingdom of Kullu</h2>
    <p>
“A window into the reflection of life, inside my soul lies a deep yearning to climb the peak up above the snow clad mountains 
of Himalayas! A time will come when I look at that mirror, where I don’t see the reflection at all for I’ll be one with these
 mountains of glory!”
As we drove past the mountainous reigons of Himachal Pradesh, while most of the mountains, look dry and surrounded by a cold 
yearning in the beginning of summer, elsewhere in India, it was a pleasant 1-5 degrees centigrades in this quaint little village 
of Kullu. About 20 odd kms from Manali and the same from Kullu, Naggar, Himachal Pradesh is the quiet little place you would want
to visit and if your intention is to just sway away from the crowded places, especially if it’s a long weekend, this is quite the 
place to be at. It was the capital of Kullu Rajas in 1460! Hence the old kingdom of Kullu, as pointed out by one of my commenters on
 my previous blog as well. Amidst breathtaking forested hills, the Naggar Castle is a magnificent historical edifice. Made of stone
and wood, this palace served as the residence of Raja Sidh Singh of Kullu. It was built in AD 1460 in an impressive amalgamation of
European and Himalayan architecture. Fireplaces, fitting staircases, and magnificent stone and wood works grace the castle’s 
interiors.Here’s some breathtaking pictures from this beautiful place which you can call home, especially if you are in love with 
the mountains!
